# Preface
I claim no credit for this code, this repository is simply to preserve the source code that was originally released under the GNU GPL.
A modern re-imagining is on my list of SWGEmu related projects, when I get to it I will not be modifying this repo, it will be forked.

## Credits
[Glitterwear/TKFashions](http://web.archive.org/web/20050130122605/http://tkfashion.swgentertainer.com/) was originally based on [Graceful Clothing Catalog](http://web.archive.org/web/20041205014355/http://aubereanjourney.com/catalog/). They then created some backend work separate from the base code to generate image previews, sadly they never released their application source.

If the original creator(s) of this stumble upon the repo and would like to add/maintain please let me know
