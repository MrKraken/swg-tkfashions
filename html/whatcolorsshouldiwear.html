<title>What colors should I wear?</title>

<body>

<p>It's never easy, particularly in a universe with such diversity in skin tones 
and body type to tell what clothes might look good on you.&nbsp; What we've 
compiled here are some basic guidelines for getting a look that will suit you.&nbsp; 
It's not foolproof, and requires some judgment, but it's far better than just 
guessing.</p>
<p><u><b><font size="4">About color:</font></b></u></p>
<p>Color is not as simple as some people would like to make it.&nbsp; Color is 
generally made up of three different attributes:&nbsp; Hue, Value, and 
Intensity.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Hue</b> is what most people think of when they think of color.&nbsp; It's 
the difference between red and blue, green and yellow, etc.&nbsp; The Hue is 
probably the first question you'll want to answer when picking a color.</p>
<p><b>Value</b> is how light or dark the chosen color is.&nbsp; For instance, 
red itself can range from a dark maroon to a light pink while still being 
technically &quot;red.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>Intensity</b> is probably the hardest of the concepts to understand.&nbsp; 
It's probably easiest to think of all colors as starting with a generic grey and 
adding more color through the entire range until the color is pure at its 
highest intensity.&nbsp; Lower Intensities will make a color look more grey or 
washed out at times.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
    <tr>
      <td width="25%" align=center><div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #ad1d1d">&nbsp;</div></td>
      <td width="25%" align=center><div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #8b213f">&nbsp;</div></td>
      <td width="25%" align=center><div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #6b3940">&nbsp;</div></td>
      <td width="25%" align=center><div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #d499aa">&nbsp;</div></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="25%">This is probably the Red most people are after, but it's 
      also one of the hardest to make and the least likely for someone to be 
      able to do.&nbsp; It's Red Hue, Medium Value, and High Intensity.</td>
      <td width="25%">This is actually the same Hue of Red that we had before, 
      only we've reduced the Value on it a great deal to get a darker Red. </td>
      <td width="25%">This is the same Hue and Value of Red as found in the 
      first box, but the Intensity has been greatly lowered, resulting in a more 
      washed out look.&nbsp; </td>
      <td width="25%">Once again, the same Red with the Value raised to nearly 
      white, giving us a nice pink.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p><u><b><font size="4">So what color goes with purple skin?</font></b></u></p>
<p>Matching the variety of skin tones in our universe is at times a challenge, 
and it's far too tempting to simply reduce everything to black or white and not 
be bothered with having to match things, but that's a very limited way to dress, 
and at best looks unimaginative.</p>
<p>But how does one begin to choose colors?&nbsp; First we need to understand 
how colors relate to each other.</p>
<p><u><b><font size="4">The Color Wheel</font></b></u></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/colorwheel.png" width="447" height="442"></p>
<p align="left">The color wheel is made up of six areas, each of which 
represents a different primary or secondary color.&nbsp; The primary colors, 
red, blue and yellow, are so called because they are the parts from which all 
other colors are made.&nbsp; They also have the distinction of not being able to 
be made up from other colors.&nbsp; Go ahead, get out your box of crayons and 
try to mix up a good red using other colors, we'll wait....</p>
<p align="left">Ok, now that we've established that, let's talk about secondary 
colors.&nbsp; The secondary colors are the ones that are made by mixing the 
primary colors that they border on.&nbsp; For instance, mixing blue and red 
produces purple, and mixing red and yellow gives us orange.&nbsp; </p>
<p><u><b><font size="4">Analogous and Complimentary Colors</font></b></u></p>
<p align="left">Now that we know what a color wheel is, how can it help us pick 
colors to wear?&nbsp; There are two more types of relationships that we need to 
know about before we start putting together an outfit.&nbsp; The first of these 
is the relationship between Analogous colors.&nbsp; Perhaps the best way to 
remember this is through a simple story about three neighbors, Ann, Al, and Gus.&nbsp; 
Since these three live next to each other, it's inevitable that they become good 
friends.&nbsp; Since they're good friends, they look good together in a group.&nbsp; 
But it's just not the same if one of them isn't there for some reason, so they 
almost always are seen together.&nbsp; Also, Al seems to be the leader of the 
group, and so any time you see them together you're probably going to see more 
of Al than the other two.&nbsp; In the same way, any three consecutive colors on 
the wheel will work pretty well together, provided that all three are present in 
some way.&nbsp; So if you're a Twi'lek with purple skin and want to have a two 
tone outfit made, consider using a red and a blue together.&nbsp; It also 
usually a good idea to ensure that the majority of the outfit is the middle 
color of the three.&nbsp; So for an outfit that covers most of your body, a blue 
with green trim might work very well.</p>
<p align="left">Complimentary colors follow that age old cantina wisdom that 
opposites attract.&nbsp; Colors that are directly opposite from each other are 
called complimentary colors.&nbsp; They generally also look very good together, 
and are well suited for two tone outfits for those with skin colors that don't 
occur on the wheel, like white, black or browns, or even for single tone outfits 
for more adventurous skin Values.&nbsp; So our purple skinned Twi'lek could do 
very well in a yellow single color outfit.</p>
<p><u><b><font size="4">Shad</font></b></u><font size="4"><b><u>es of meaning...</u></b></font></p>
<p align="left">So what happens if my skin isn't actually a strong, intense 
middle Value of purple, but more of a less intense light purple?&nbsp; Simply 
adjust the other colors in a similar way and go with a pale blue and pink 
outfit, or perhaps a pale yellow dress.&nbsp; Sometimes doing precisely the 
opposite, that is, going with a darker color on lighter skin, can work well, but 
results will vary.</p>
<p><u><b><font size="4">But...what about my black duster?</font></b></u></p>
<p align="left">So you still want to wear black, eh?&nbsp; /sigh.&nbsp; Ok, you 
can do that with most any skin color, but realize that pure black or pure white 
outfits generally tend to look pretty boring.&nbsp; Adding just a little 
variation can really vitalize an outfit.&nbsp; (Greys don't count as variation 
in this sense, I'm afraid...)&nbsp; Experiment with adding a dash of red, green, 
or maybe a blue.&nbsp; I think you'll be pleased with the results.</p>
<p align="left">Hope this is helpful, but remember that it's intended only as a 
beginning for people with no clue how to work out colors.&nbsp; There are many, 
many other combinations that can work, and the best way to find them is to try 
them and see.&nbsp; Trust your instincts.&nbsp; If an outfit looks just a little 
&quot;off&quot; to you, chances are that it is, even if you can't put a finger on why.&nbsp;
