<P>Glitterwear Boutique and TK Fashion would like to thank Clarin of Graceful Clothiers, without whom we would have had to build everything from the ground up, and Severine of Glitterwear, who was the original inspiration to try and create a tailor catalog, and put up with early attempts at reproducing clothing colors before I could create the screenshots myself.</P>
